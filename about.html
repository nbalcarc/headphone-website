            Our mission is to provide reliable advice for people looking for new headphones.
            Whether you're looking for your first set of cans, or simply want to grow your collection,
                you've come to the right place.
            Sound Reviews was founded by a single person, Nathan Balcarcel,
                and has grown to a whopping 1 employees!
            As we collect more audio equipment, we plan to provide more reviews and comparisons.
            Additionally, we're planning on adding amplifier reviews, and expanding our IEM catalog.
            We hope you find our reviews useful, and if you have any comments make sure to contact us.
