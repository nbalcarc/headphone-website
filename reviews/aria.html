        <h1>Moondrop Aria - Decent IEMs When They Came Out</h1>
        <h2>Build</h2>
        <p>
            The Arias are built very solidly.
            They're made of metal, resulting in a heavier weight than most other IEM's.
            I can imagine these earbuds surviving a harsh drop, however the paint would likely scratch off.
            The cable is braided, but not build particularly sturdy.
            It felt fragile, leading me to eventually replace it with an aftermarket cable from Linsoul.
        </p>
        <h2>Frequency Response</h2>
        <p>
            While the sound signature of the Arias is inoffensive, it suffers in natural tonality.
            The bass is ample, though not super detailed.
            It does tend to muddy up the lower mids, but overall is well-balanced.
            Vocals tend to be a little shouty at times, and never seem to sound natural to my ears.
            I've played around with equalizers, but it never sounds realistic enough for me.
            The treble is mostly smooth, with one or two peaks keeping you on your toes.
            In general I find that I can turn up the volume and find myself comfortable with the frequency response, as no particular frequency is harsh.
        </p>
        <h2>Soundstage and Imaging</h2>
        <p>
            Imaging is not great, but the soundstage can be.
            There isn't that pinpoint accuracy you'd expect from more expensive IEM's, but at its price point does put up a fight.
            The soundstage is pill-shaped, a common trend with IEM's.
            Sometimes I can hear well-defined left and right directionality, however the forward and backward directions feel squished towards you in comparison.
            This can give the illusion of a large soundstage and close vocals, which is convincing at best and very artificial at worst.
            On the bus at night, the soundstage can be quite satisfactory however, and I've had moments where I forgot the sound wasn't coming from my environment.
        </p>
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
            While the Arias have served me a great purpose on my 6-hour-long bus rides home during breaks from university, I feel like one could find better.
            The frequency response, soundstage, and dynamics are all decent, but for the $80 price tag one could likely find something more impressive nowadays.
            I will recommend them as a good option, but do look elsewhere before finalizing your decision on these.
