        <h1>Sennheiser HD 6XX - A Solid Set of Cans</h1>
        <h2>Build</h2>
        <p>
            Although mostly plastic, the HD 6XX is a very sturdy set of cans that I expect to last for many years.
            The plastic build makes the headphones very lightweight when compared to something that utilizes metal,
                yet I can say the 6XX has survived a number of drops just fine.
            I've never felt any problem with build quality.
            The actual band that goes around your head contains a flexible piece of metal inside.
            I feel that the adjustment mechanism is well-made, and should widthstand constant use.
            Two things to note are the clamp force and the earpad longevity.
            The clamp force can be very strong depending on your head size,
                and I've found that the force has not reduced significantly in the 2 years I've owned them.
            There are ways to reduce the strength by bending the metal band, but I haven't tried this myself.
            As for the earpads, they don't last very long.
            After extended use the earpads begin to flatten significantly, 
                and I find it best to replace them yearly because this flattening does impact the sound negatively.
            Keep your earpads maintained and you'll be smooth sailing for years.

        <h2>Frequency Response</h2>
        <p>
            I find the tonality to be a mixed bag, but overall I'd describe it as dark and vocal-emphasizing.
            The sub is lacking, and the midbass can sound bloated to some.
            I personally find it reasonably balanced.
            As we move to the mids, these sound very clear and clean.
            I find vocals to be a toss-up.
            In some tracks, the vocals are not natural at all, and sound very artificial.
            In other cases, I find the 6XX to have the most natural vocals I've ever heard out of any headphones.
            This may be influenced by the mastering of the tracks, where better mastering leads to a more natural sound.
            The treble is lacking, leading to the dark tonality people know the 6XX for.
            I personally boost the sub significantly, and reduce the 300db region on solid-state amplifiers,
                but I leave the eq alone when on tube amps.

        <h2>Soundstage and Imaging</h2>
        <p>
            The soundstage and imaging are both not great on these cans.
            Sounds are in your head, and people tend to notice a 3-blob effect (front, left, right) for the imaging.
            This does mean that vocals are very intimate, allowing you to pick apart the details very easily.
            Personally, I think this leads to the best sounding vocals I've heard, given the right tracks,
                which more than makes up for the lacking spacials.
        </p>
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
            Overall, for their relatively low price of $200 USD I believe they're a great set of headphones to have.
            Many find the sound, particularly the detail and tonality, to increase significantly with good amplifiers.
            Most enthusiasts own an HD 6XX or an HD 600 as part of their collection, and you shouldn't miss out.
