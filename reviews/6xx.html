        <h2>Build</h2>
        <p>
            Although mostly plastic, the HD 6XX is a very sturdy set of cans that I expect to last for many years.
            The plastic build makes the headphones very lightweight when compared to something that utilizes metal,
                yet I can say the 6XX has survived a number of drops just fine.
            I've never felt any problem with build quality.
            The actual band that goes around your head contains a flexible piece of metal inside.
            I feel that the adjustment mechanism is well-made, and should widthstand constant use.
            Two things to note are the clamp force and the earpad longevity.
            The clamp force can be very strong depending on your head size,
                and I've found that the force has not reduced significantly in the 2 years I've owned them.
            There are ways to reduce the strength by bending the metal band, but I haven't tried this myself.
            As for the earpads, they don't last very long.
            After extended use the earpads begin to flatten significantly, 
                and I find it best to replace them yearly because this flattening does impact the sound negatively.
            Keep your earpads maintained and you'll be smooth sailing for years.
