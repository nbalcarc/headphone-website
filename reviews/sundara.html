        <h1>HiFiMan Sundara - The Best In My Collection</h1>
        <h2>Build</h2>
        <p>
            While the Sundara is built with solid materials, the way it's put together is not very sturdy.
            The cups and headrest are mostly metal, with light plastic for the adjustment mechanism.
            There are no pivot points anywhere, which leads to a more solid build but less adaptability for variously shaped heads.
            The pads are comfortable, but could be too small for larger ears, and start to flatten after weeks or months of usage.
            The main gripe for me is the adjustment mechanism.
            It feels very crude, with it getting stuck very easily and scraping the paint off the metal.
            If any part were to break, I feel this would be it.
        </p>
        <h2>Frequency Response</h2>
        <p>
            The Sundaras sound natural, leaning more clinical.
            There is great bass extension, however there isn't a large quantity.
            The rest of the frequencies are very balanced and natural.
            There is a slightly higher treble response when compared to other headphones, leading to a brighter sound signature.
            This can make poorly mastered music sounds peaky or even harsh, but handles very well on properly-mastered tracks.
            I personally increase the lower bass and sub-bass, and tend to bring down the 2k region.
            For a more flat sound, you'll actually want to lift 2k slightly, but I've tuned it to my personal taste.
            Here's my eq preset:
        </p>
        <li>Low Shelf 50hz, Q 0.70, +3dB</li>
        <li>Low Shelf 100hz, Q 0.70, +2dB</li>
        <li>Peak 2500hz, Q 2.00, -2dB</li>
        <h2>Soundstage and Imaging</h2>
        <p>
            I find soundstage to be decent, and imaging to be fairly good.
            There's definitely more of the two when compared to something like HD 6XX's, but aren't as big and impressive as something like an HD 800s.
            The soundstage is not perfectly round, and there is some wonkiness to the shape, however it's definitely sufficient for someone looking to enjoy orchestral music.
            Imaging, while not pinpoint, is good enough for gaming, and beats out most of the gaming-centric headphones on the market today.
            I personally find the imaging to be fairly nice for my purposes, however I do see myself wishing for something a little larger from time to time.
        </p>
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
            These headphones are solid for their price of $350.
            Since I first got them, they've been my main, and I use them almost every day.
            The better the mastering of the track, the better the sound is what I've found.
            It's detailed, it's decently wide, good frequency response, just very well-rounded.
            Likely the reason for this is the planar-magnetic drivers, which tend to increase bass and treble extension.
            Most of my gripes with it are smoothened out with my custom eq preset, which I recommend anyone try if they're looking for slight adjustments.
            These cans get a big recommendation from me, and everyone should get a chance to listen to them.
