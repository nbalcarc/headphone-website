        <h1>HarmonicDyne Zeus - A Good Supporting Headphone</h1>
        <h2>Build</h2>
        <p>
            The build for the Zeus is a strange one, with mixes plastic and metal.
            Personally I find the adjustment mechanism to be atrocious.
            It rattles around, and gives me no confidence that it won't just fall apart someday.
            The cups have a massive amount of swivel, which is great for adaptability but I have found that it leads to me mishandling the Zeus often, so be careful about that.
            One important note is that apart from the angled cups, the headphones have front-back symmetry, so I find myself putting them on backwards often when I'm not paying attention.
            If you hear a muffled and dark sound (more than usual), make sure they're on the right way.
        </p>
        <h2>Frequency Response</h2>
        <p>
            I have mixed feelings about the frequency response.
            The bass is definitely bloated more than other headphones I've tried out, which leads to a very muddy sound with many tracks.
            The mids feel recessed, and the treble is peaky while also being slightly recessed.
            This means you can't simply decrease the treble to handle the peaks, because the overall treble would be too quiet.
            As a result, I've found that many types of music, especially vocal-heavy tracks, simply aren't as enjoyable as on my Sundaras.
            However, one genre that I have found to sound amazing on these headphones is drift phonk.
            The sound signature of the Zeus complements drift phonk very well, more than any of my other headphones.
            I do use a parametric equalizer on these headphones, which I'll provide here:
        </p>
        <li>Peak 21hz, Q 1.41, +3dB</li>
        <li>Peak 60hz, Q 1.41, +2dB</li>
        <li>Peak 180hz, Q 1.41, -1dB</li>
        <li>Peak 333hz, Q 1.41, -3dB</li>
        <li>Peak 750hz, Q 1.64, -1dB</li>
        <li>Peak 1400hz, Q 1.50, -2dB</li>
        <li>Peak 2500hz, Q 2.00, -4dB</li>
        <li>Peak 4200hz, Q 2.00, +1dB</li>
        <li>Peak 7750hz, Q 3.00, -2dB</li>
        <p>
            This equalizer preset improves the sound significantly for me, although it could use some tuning for personal preference.
            Another point to note is you can run these on a tube amp with a low impedence.
            Under this circumstance, the sound is more pleasant than on a solid state, but doesn't fundamentally change the sound.
        </p>
        <h2>Soundstage and Imaging</h2>
        <p>
            On the Zeus, I find the soundstage and imaging rather impressive for its somewhat closed nature.
            Although technically open-back, I find the Zeus to have little noise leakage, so it's definitely a more enclosed sound.
            Despite this, I find the soundstage to be on par with the Sundara, sometimes larger depending on the track.
            The imaging will depend on the track; never pinpoint but more than adequate for its soundstage.
            This again makes phonk sound very nice on these headphones, and orchestral music is likely very enjoyable if you can put up with the mediocre sound signature.
        </p>
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
            The Zeus serves its best role as a supporter headphone.
            I wouldn't own the Zeus as my primary headphone, but rather as a secondary one that complements your primary set.
            For me, this means dual-wielding my Sundara and my Zeus, where the Sundara serves to be analytical and digital, whereas the Zeus is more pleasant to listen to.
            Although this sounds like I'm docking on the Zeus, I use my set very often, replacing my Sundara for days at a time.
            For the price of $350, I'd consider this a decent set of cans that can offer a new sound.
