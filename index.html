            Welcome to Sound Advice, where we give... well... sound advice!
            We cover headphones, IEM's, and amplifiers, with new articles on the way.
            To explore our reviews, learn more about us, or contact us, refer to the navigation bar above.

            On this site, you can find our catalog of reviews, where we cover both headphones and IEM's.
            When it comes to a topic as subjective as audio, it's good to hear as many perspectives as possible before purchasing anything.
            This is the main purpose for Sound Advice's existence: we provide our opinions on popular audio equipment.
            Our reviews won't match perfectly with others' reviews, and that's a good thing!
            As someone looking to buy new products, I look for people with a similar opinion to my own.
            This way I can guarantee I'm buying something I will enjoy.

            Admittedly, I have not used a large variety of audio equipment.
            Even so, I hope these reviews will help provide an anchor point from which you can deduce the quality of other equipment not reviewed here.
            As I gain new equipment, I will add their reviews on this site.
            I will soon be providing reviews of my Schiit stack, as pictured above, and my Valhalla 2.
            Stay tuned for more content in the future!
